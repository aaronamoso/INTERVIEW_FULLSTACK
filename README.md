A complete MERN stack interview prep 

Here’s a 10-day study guide

**Day 1: HTML & CSS Fundamentals**
Topics to Study:
HTML basics: Structure, semantic tags (<header>, <footer>, <main>).
    ** (begin tag)<div (attribute name)class="content"(attribute value)(begin tag)>Element value</div>(end tag)
Forms: Inputs, buttons, labels, form validation (required, pattern).

CSS: Selectors, box model, positioning (flexbox, grid).
Practice:
Create a simple form for user registration (name, email, password).
Style the form with a responsive layout.

**Day 2: JavaScript Basics**
Topics to Study:
Variables (let, const, var) and data types.
Control structures: if-else, loops (for, while).
Functions: Declaration, arrow functions, parameters, and return values.
Practice:
Write a function to check if a number is prime.
Create a loop to print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz."

**Day 3: DOM Manipulation**
Topics to Study:
Selecting elements: document.querySelector, getElementById.
Event listeners: addEventListener, event handling.
Dynamic DOM updates: Adding/removing elements.
Nodes
Practice:
Build a dynamic to-do list where users can add and remove items.
Create a form with real-time validation (e.g., highlight errors as the user types).

**Day 4: Node.js Basics**
Topics to Study:
Setting up a Node.js project (npm init).
Creating a simple server using http or Express.js.
Understanding asynchronous programming (setTimeout, Promises, async/await).
Practice:
Build a basic server that returns a "Hello, World!" message.
Create an endpoint that returns a JSON object with mock user data.

**Day 5: Express.js and REST APIs**
Topics to Study:
Routing: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
Middleware basics: body-parser, error handling.
Creating and consuming RESTful APIs.
Practice:
Create an API with routes for adding, retrieving, and deleting products.
Handle input validation for the POST route (e.g., ensure all fields are filled).

**Day 6: SQL and Databases**
Topics to Study:
SQL Basics: CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Filtering: WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
Basic joins: Combining data from two tables.
Practice:
Create a table users and add mock data.
Write queries to:
Retrieve all users.
Update a user's email based on their ID.

**Day 7: MongoDB Basics**
Topics to Study:
Understanding collections and documents.
CRUD operations with MongoDB.
Querying documents: Filters and projections.
Practice:
Insert mock user data into a MongoDB collection.
Write queries to find all users with age > 25 and update a specific user’s details.

**Day 8: React Basics**
Topics to Study:
Setting up a React project.
Components, props, and state management.
Handling events and updating the UI.
Practice:
Build a simple React app to display a list of products from an array.
Add a form to allow users to add new products dynamically.

**Day 9: Algorithms and Problem Solving**
Topics to Study:
Common algorithms: String manipulation, array operations.
Sorting and searching: Bubble sort, linear search.
Practice problems for coding efficiency and debugging.
Practice:
Write a function to reverse a string.
Solve a problem to find the maximum number in an array without using built-in methods.

**Day 10: Debugging and Mock Interview**
Topics to Study:
Debugging techniques in VS Code: Breakpoints, call stack, console.log.
Review Git commands for version control.
Practice explaining your thought process while coding.

**Mock Interview:**
Simulate a 15-minute assessment:
Write a front-end task (e.g., create a form with validation).
Implement a simple back-end API (e.g., fetch user data).

**Day 11-14:** Review and Algorithm Practice
**Day 11-12:** Revise all studied topics.

Practice building a small project integrating front-end, back-end, and database.
Review key JavaScript concepts: closures, callbacks, and async/await.
**Day 13-14:** Focus on algorithms.

**Solve 3-4 problems per day on:**
Array manipulation (e.g., removing duplicates).
String operations (e.g., checking palindromes).
Simple algorithms (e.g., FizzBuzz, prime numbers).
Simulate a full 20-minute interview to build confidence.

**Additional Resources:**
Practice Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank (basic problems only).
Cheat Sheets: Git commands, SQL syntax, JavaScript functions.
Books/Videos: "Eloquent JavaScript" or relevant YouTube tutorials.
By splitting your preparation into this 10-day structured study followed by targeted review and practice, you’ll be well-prepared for the interview and coding assessment. Good luck!
