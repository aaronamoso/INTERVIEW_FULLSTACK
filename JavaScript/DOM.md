Document Object Model
Object{} that represents the page you see in the web browser and provides
you with an API to interact with it. 
Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document, and 
structures all the elements in a tree-like representation. JS can access 
the DOM to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page
